# Perceptron-Model
Perceptron model is a class to perform binary classification using Python and following libraries:

Numpy
Pandas
Matplotlib

This model can be easily extended to perform multi-class classification problem (One-vs-Rest). Perceptron model works best when two classes can be separated by linear hyperplane.
Below are the data visualization of 2 classes and number of misclassification per iteration.

The class can be initiated by passing learning rate and number of iterations.
